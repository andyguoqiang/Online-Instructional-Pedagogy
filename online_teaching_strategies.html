<p>In
order to achieve predetermined learning goals and objectives, online
instructors need to identify and employ appropriate instructional
strategies to best facilitate the course and to engage students
throughout their online learning experiences. Instructional strategies
determine how the online course will be developed and implemented. <br />
<br />
Although developed for traditional face-to-face instruction, most
instructional strategies available can also be successfully adapted for
facilitating online learning. The rapid development of technology over
the past decade has made these strategies available for online
instructors to apply to their online courses. Five major categories of
instructional strategies are introduced below:<br />
<br />
<strong>1. Direct Instruction</strong><br />
Direct Instruction is an explicit, intensive instructional method that
is highly teacher-directed and skills-oriented. Direct instruction
emphasizes the use of clear and concise language to break concepts into
manageable steps. The strategy is effective for providing explicit and
guided information and developing step-by-step skills. <br />
There are many methods and tools that can be considered for direct
instruction, such as structure overview, mastery lecture, explicit
teaching, drill and practice, compare and contrast, didactic questions,
demonstrations, guided reading and listening, and so on. Several
methods and tools are highlighted below: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Lecture:
Lecture is one of the most frequently used instructional methods. It
assumes that the instructors are experts and responsible for
disseminating information. Lectures can be delivered either at the
beginning of the learning module as an introduction to the course
content or at the end of the module as a summary of the key concepts
covered in the module. It is usually used in combination with other
instructional strategies. In online courses, lectures can be delivered
in a variety of forms. For example, lectures can be presented via audio
or video and embedded in the modules. Lectures can also be created with
PowerPoint and linked to the course site. In addition, lecture notes
can be uploaded onto the course site for learners to review.</li>
  <li>Didactic
Questions: Didactic questioning helps the instructor to structure the
learning process of students. Didactic questions tend to be convergent,
factual, and often gein with “what”, “where”, “when”, and “how“. They
can be effectively used to diagnose recall and comprehension skills, to
draw on prior learning experiences, to determine the extent to which
lesson objectives were achieved, to provide practice, and to aid
retention of information or processes. Online instructors should note
that didactic questions need to be provided with explicit instructions
so that students have less confusions.</li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<strong>2. Indirect Instruction</strong><br />
Indirect instruction is a highly learner-centered strategy. It takes
advantage of students’ interests and curiosity by involving them in
observing, investigating, and/or solving problems. The role of the
instructor is to facilitate and mentor with suggestions or hints.
Indirect instruction can support active learning and critical thinking,
and help students develop metacognitive skills. <br />
There are many methods and tools that can be considered for indirect
instruction such as problem solving, case studies, reading for meaning,
webquest, reflective discussion, writing to inform, concept formation,
concept mapping, and so on. Several methods and tools are highlighted
below: </p>
<ul>
  <li>WebQuest:
WebQuest is a learning activity during which learners read, analyze,
and synthesize information using the World Wide Web. Learners typically
complete WebQuests as cooperative groups. Each learner within a group
can be given a "role," or specific area to research. WebQuests may take
the form of role-playing scenarios, where students take on the personas
of professional researchers or historical figures. WebQuests do not
have to be developed as a true web site. They may be developed and
implemented using lower threshold (less demanding) technologies. For
example, they may be saved as a word document or PowerPoint slides.</li>
  <li>Case
Studies: Case studies are stories or scenarios, often in narrative
form, created and used as a tool for analysis and discussion. Case
studies are tools for engaging students in research and reflective
discussion. Case studies can also be adopted in the online learning and
higher order thinking can be greatly generated throughout the
investigation process.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<strong>3. Interactive Instruction: </strong><br />
Interactive Instruction is a strategy that heavily relies on
discussion, debate and sharing among participants. Interactive
instruction is effective for promoting students’ social skills and
ability to organize their thoughts and rational arguments. <br />
There are many methods and tools that can be considered for interactive
instruction such as debates, role playing, instructor commentary,
brainstorming, group work, peer review, online discussion, structured
controversy, audio interviewing, online conferencing, and so on.
Several methods and tools are highlighted below: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Online
Discussion: Online discussion is a widely used instructional strategy
for online courses because it encourages active participations and
interactions from the students, and helps to create a sense of learning
community. Online discussion forum is a place where students share
resources, negotiate meanings, and construct knowledge collaboratively.
As the center of interaction and learning, online discussion is
regarded as the core of an online course. Therefore, it is important to
appropriately design online discussion activities and foster productive
online discussions. There are two types of online discussion:
asynchronous online discussion and synchronous online discussion.</li>
  <li>Group
Work/Project: In online courses, group work provides opportunities for
students to interact with each other as well as with the course
content. Students can ask questions, explore ideas, and solve problems
together by working in groups. There are many different types of small
group activities. Here we list three types of activities commonly seen
in online courses.</li>
  <ul>
    <ol>
      <ol>
        <li>Group Discussion : It allows students to reflect on a topic
and share their views.</li>
        <li>Group
Project: It allows students to gain practical experience from
completing a project such as case studying, solving problems,
brainstorming, and so on.</li>
        <li>Role Playing: It
allows students to understand other people's positions and
responsibilities through acting out various roles. It can help them
understand the range of concerns, values, and positions held by other
people.</li>
      </ol>
    </ol>
  </ul>
</ul>
<p><strong>4. Independent Study</strong><br />
Independent study is a mode of instruction whereby a student works
individually with the instructor. The student works independently on a
plan that is guided and supervised by the instructor. Independent study
is effective in fostering the development of students’ initiative,
self-reliance, and self-improvement. Independent learning activities
are necessary for students to develop deep understandings of the course
content. For example, asking students to keep an individual reflection
journal or to complete an assignment independently may help them fully
understand the content. <br />
There are many methods and tools that can be considered for independent
instruction such as essays, blogs, journals, reports, portfolio, and
research projects. Several methods and tools are highlighted below: <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Blogs:
Blogging is a simple and straightforward way to help students integrate
content, process, and personal feelings. Writing on a blog helps
students learn from writing rather than writing what they have learned.
Blogs are commonly used in assessing literacy but there are many
crossovers into content areas other than those associated with reading
and writing. Blogging can be done as a role playing activity, to
timeline historical events and to collaborate with peers and audiences
beyond the class. </li>
  <li>Journals: Journal writing is a
learning tool based on the ideas that students write to learn. Students
use the journals to write about topics of personal interest, to note
their observations, to imagine, to wonder and to connect new
information with things they already know. Using journals fosters
learning in many ways. Students who use journals are actively engaged
in their own learning and have the opportunity to clarify and reflect
upon their thinking.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p><br />
<strong>5. Experiential Learning</strong><br />
Experiential learning is an inductive, learner centered, and activity
oriented strategy. Personalized reflection on experiences and the
formulation of plans to apply learning to other contexts are critical
factors. Experiential learning is effective &nbsp;in providing
opportunities
for students to engage and apply academic understandings through
hands-on experience. <br />
There are many methods and tools that can be considered for
experiential instruction such as simulations, field observation, games,
storytelling, surveys, and so on. Several methods and tools are
highlighted below: <br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Field
Experience: Field Experience can be utilized in online learning as
well. For example, an art-management-majoring online student can go to
his/her local museums and find out the management structure, styles and
issues/concerns in the museums.<br />
Games and Simulations: Games and
simulations allow learners to practice skills, apply knowledge and
learn concepts while having fun. Technologies such as Second Life
(www.secondlife.com) provide virtual environment for students to
explore, and simulations can offer students experiences that might be
impossible in real life.<br />
