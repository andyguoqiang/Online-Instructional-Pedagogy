<p><strong>Online Interaction </strong><br />
Developing opportunities
for online interaction is essential for a successful online course.
Students are greatly dependent on the facilitation of offering
opportunities for interaction. Moore (1989) identified three types of
interactions that are important for learning and engagement, including
learner-content, learner-instructor, and learner-learner. Learn more
about how to ensure your online and hybrid courses are highly
interactive learning environments. </p>

<p align="center">Moore (1989)</p>
<p><em>Learner-content interaction </em>is
the communication process between the learner and the content or
subject of study. Learners typically construct meaning and
understanding through the learning content and this is also a defining
characteristic of education. <br />
<br />
There are several ways to facilitate learner-content interaction:<br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Stimulate prior knowledge and "hook" your students into engaging
with new concepts. </li>
  <li>Present
subject matter by using appropriate media. You can use charts, graphs,
process maps, and timelines into your course to make complicated ideas
visual. These additions can serve as advance organizers to help
students understand what they will learn in a unit. You may consider
recording a podcast of some of the content that may normally be
delivered in print or PowerPoint. Vary the way you deliver content
using a variety of methods that support students diverse learning
styles. </li>
  <li>Add interactive elements to encourage
active learning. These can be as simple as rollovers (i.e., when the
mouse rolls over text or an image on the screen, additional information
pops up) or hyperlinks to additional information help to keep the
visual design simple yet engaging. Offer exercises and activities for
students to engage with course content. This is helpful for students to
self-check their understanding of concepts through ungraded tools.
Activities can provide feedback and reinforcement for students on
specific concepts. Using pre and post exercises can help students gauge
their own understanding and comfort with new content.</li>
  <li>An
online discussion forum is a place where students share resources,
negotiate meanings, and construct knowledge collaboratively. As the
center of interaction and learning, online discussion is regarded as
the core of an online course. Therefore, it is important to
appropriately design online discussion activities and foster productive
online discussions. </li>
  <li>In online courses, group
work provides opportunities for students to interact with each other as
well as with the course content. Students can ask questions, explore
ideas, and solve problems together by working in groups. There are many
different types of small group activities. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Learner-instructor interaction</em> is the interaction between
the learner and the expert who prepared the subject material. The
instructor serves as a facilitator, guiding students through
independent or group learning activities and provides feedback directly
to students. Student-to-faculty interaction is extremely important in
order to keep students focused on the content and provide feedback
-both positive and corrective. This type of interaction should be built
into all online courses. </p>
<p><br />
<strong>How to Facilitate Learner-Instructor Interactions</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Feedback
and Reinforcement: Feedback and reinforcement can take on many forms;
email communication, audio recorded comments on assignments, or
comments on blogs, journals, and class projects. </li>
  <li>Office
Hours and Meetings: Meetings can be arranged during office hour blocks
or via private meeting times using Blackboard IM, Skype, and many
others. Consider that some students may not be able to meet during
conventional business hours.</li>
  <li>Messages and
Announcements: You may want to send regular messages out to all
students, selected groups or individual students to provide additional
information, feedback or recommendations. This is helpful in keeping
your course dynamic and for students to sense the instructor's presence
between meetings or activities.<br />
  </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Learner-learner interaction</em>
is where students take information that they have read or listened to
and begin to build their understanding through dialogue with others. It
could be the interaction between one learner and other learners, alone
or in group settings, with or without the real-time presence of an
instructor. It is through using information that it becomes knowledge.<br />
<br />
<strong>How to Create Learner-to-Learner Interaction</strong><br />
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Partner or small group assignments that support collaborative
critical thinking and problem solving</li>
  <li>Peer review activities that guide students to interact with each
other's work</li>
  <li>Open forums for students to share ideas with each other such as
wikis, blogs, Discussion Boards, Cyber Cafe, etc.</li>
